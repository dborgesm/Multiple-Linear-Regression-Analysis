# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

The objective of the project was to perform a multiple linear regression analysis to predict the number of registered members that used this bike-sharing system, and identify behaviors depending on the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, and other factors could affect rental behavior. Performing this analysis would help to understand better the trends depending on the season and the relationship between the total number of registered users and the variables of interests.

The data of the project was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset). In addition, the brief report can be found [here](https://github.com/dborgesm/Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis/blob/master/Bike-Sharing-Analysis.md) and the code of the analysis [here](https://github.com/dborgesm/Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis/blob/master/Bike%20Sharing.R)
